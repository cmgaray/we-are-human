<h1>Remove Trump: Defend the Constitution</h1>
<p>Donald Trump has repeatedly violated the US Constitution and shown clear authoritarian and fascist tendencies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inciting an insurrection (January 6th, 2021)</li>
  <li>Attempting to overturn democratic elections</li>
  <li>Threatening press freedom and attacking judicial independence</li>
  <li>Separating families and violating human rights through ICE policies</li>
  <li>Calling for political violence and revenge campaigns against opponents</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a constitutional emergency. Trump is a threat to democracy. Demand his disqualification and removal from public office under the 14th Amendment, Section 3.</p>
